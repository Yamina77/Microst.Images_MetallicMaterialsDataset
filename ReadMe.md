Presentations 
1- Metallic samples :
The samples were prepared with an established procedure, providing high surface quality. First, specimens with
a 20 x20 mm2 square surface were cut from the received plates. The obtained
samples were then, prepared for metallography by a conventional polishing, on
turning disks with grinding papers of different grit size in six steps (P320, P500,
P800, P1000, P1200, and P2400). The final polishing was performed by adding
an alumina standard suspension onto the rotating disk to obtain a mirror surfaces.
Finally, the polished samples were washed with ethanol and dried with
air; a subsequent etching with adequate chemical reagent is performed to reveal
the different microstructures.

2- Micrographic images acquisition :

The images acquisition was done by means of a light optical microscope
(Nikon-Eclipse), equipped with objective lenses and camera for maximum optical
resolution. The images are saved in :JPG format, with different observation
scales (20 mico-m, 50 mico-m, 100 mico-m), and resolutions (640 x 480, 2560 x 1920). 


3- Dataset:
The dataset contains a total of 90 images. They are regrouped in the folder nammed "3_familiesOfSteels ". Each gards is regrouped in folder as follows:
    1- Austinitic Stainless Steel: 30 .jpg images; 
    2- Carbone Steel: 30 .jpg images;
    3- Duplex Xtainless Steel: 30 .jpg images;
